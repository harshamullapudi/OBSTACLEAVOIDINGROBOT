# OBSTACLEAVOIDINGROBOT
Sensor Based Obstacle Avoiding Robot Car for cleaning purpose using Arduino-UNO/Microcontroller and Bluetooth/Sensor.

#ABSTRACT
The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile robot car with an obstacle avoidance capability. The mobile robot will be built with an on-board sensor to get information about the surding environment. The mobile robot is a four wheeled robot platform. The robot has an ultrasonic sensor which is mounted in front of it to scan the front environment. The ultrasonic sensor will trigger a signal to the main controller, which is a Arduino UNO and it is controlled by blue-tooth module HC-05 7
8 The direction of the mobile robot will be controlled by one stepper motor that connected to the output of Arduino UNO. The stepper motor will change the direction of mobile robot when an obstacle is detected. The other two wheels are dc motor which is only for motion purpose. The dc motor will be only run forward without influenced by the obstacle senses by ultrasonic sensor.
